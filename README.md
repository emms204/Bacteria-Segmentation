# Bacteria-Segmentation
Implementation of the U-Net segmentation architecture for the segmentation of bacteria and blood cells in blood samples.

## Dataset source
https://www.kaggle.com/longnguyen2306/bacteria-detection-with-darkfield-microscopy
The dataset was an imbalanced one such that the number of bacteria cells far outnumbered that of blood cells however, because given the real-cost of the model in that it should accurately detect all bacteria cells I aimed for a high precision. The dataset with way more number of bacteria cells was very good at detecting such in any blood sample.
